The new Darvas box trading 2.0 method combines what worked in the past with todayâ€™s tools to help refine the setup conditions and the trigger for the trade. 
This Darvas box trading 2.0 setup is long-only as detailed below:

* Use the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMAs) on the daily chart.
* Price is trading within 10% of an all-time high and above the 20-day and 50-day SMAs.
* Price stays within this 10% range for a minimum of three weeks. Support and resistance are established, forming a rectangle or box-like price pattern.
* Trade up through resistance on greater than 30-day average volume. Price closes above the previous price high.
* Enter on the opening of the following trading day.

### TLDR;

Adding the SMAs acts as a filter to keep you in stocks that are trending higher and out of stocks whose price action is weak. Also, your entries are better 
timed by having a specific level of volume at the time of your entry to establish the quality of the breakout to the upside.
