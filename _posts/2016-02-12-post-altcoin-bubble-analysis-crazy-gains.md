### What did Urocoin, Crave and Expanse (Ethereum clone) have in common?

They all first lingered as a small market cap coin--around $20,000 to $40,000. They all have a small coin supply --around 200,000 to 1 million.

I suspect they have a pump team behind the rally. All made more than 500% increase in price. Lastly, enough hype to start the pump. It seems too that 
no fundamental reason for price increase is needed or it’s just an excuse to rally.

I’ll probably going to remember this for future pumps.
