Limit closed my 16,395 pips long #bitcoin futures position. OMG the funding fees! Maybe better if I had used regular quarterly futures but which is less liquid?

The logic here is that the chances of breaking through ATHs on first attempt is very low, something like 1 of 10? Only time it does is frenzied buying 
momentum caused by retail. What we have here is measured movements. There will be retrace however small it is.

However, this is one of those nobrainer trades. We all know there will be a pump prior to Bitcoin halving like what happens before every halving in its 
price history.
