One disastrous trade and all your trading capital is wiped out. Then you may have to start from the minimum amount you can afford or just quit because
it’s unnerving to get rekt.</p>
<p name="8f6f" id="8f6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To manage risk, some traders spread their capital into several assets, it’s kind of basically investing in the industry — the altcoin markets, that is.</p><p name="8ff8" id="8ff8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a good strategy, but really time-consuming to monitor all your altcoin bagholds.</p><p name="7f1c" id="7f1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I, however, just focus on one or two cryptocurrencies to trade and just use adequate position sizing depending on the situation, the information available and of course, the strength of the hype.</p><p name="ec66" id="ec66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My style is a modified martingale betting system where in a series of bad trades you increase your position size. Of course, you <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">should never</strong> use this if you have <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">zero knowledge of technical analysis.</strong></p><p name="5120" id="5120" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have been using this system for more than a year with some form of gambling and I have never lose a single gambling session. (Well, maybe someday I will lose all, lol).</p><p name="a490" id="a490" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, this system is a perfect supplement if you’re a TA wizard, it will protect your capital. Yes, it looks like it’s designed for small wins, but it will ensure you’ll enjoy a long trading career as opposed to those rich-overnight-but-lost-all-the-next-day, extreme risk takers.</p><p name="a03f" id="a03f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You may download <a href="http://go.cur.lv/riskmanagementworksheet" data-href="http://go.cur.lv/riskmanagementworksheet" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><blockquote name="14ec" id="14ec" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">Reminder: let your winners run and cut your losses early</blockquote></div></div></section>
