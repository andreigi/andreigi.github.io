I think I got it wrong. I think I should really be grateful for crypto. Yes, it pains me to remember the regrets, the what-could-have-been, missed 
opportunities, and I could have had millions of dollars by now.

You know, in crypto you can never really be satisfied. Why? Because I had many regrets. I regret selling too early my stacks of Ethereum, NEO (Antshares), 
Decred airdrop, Stellar airdrop, and a lot of others. They are 10x plus more expensive by now.... Recently, I regret not selling the now worthless tokens 
I have in my possession. 

You can never be satisfied with your crypto trading. You will regret selling too early, regret selling too late. Though come to think of it, nobody can truly
sell or buy crypto at the right time.

The only thing I can think about is really how lucky I am. I didn't lose any actual capital. 90% of the tokens I hold comes from bounties, airdrop,or mining; not 
from purchases.

I remember investing around 600 US dollars.... That's it, out of that came hundreds of thousands.

At first look, you have now a garbage collection of tokens. Buuuut that's the problem... You see it as a negative (the trash tokens). You shouldn't; because out
of the many trash tokens you have, you had hidden gems. You sold Dent which you had used for an expensive IVF procedure (An amount that will take two years of 
saving). You made eight years worth of salary in ETH from the thing you did in 2017. And some of your tokens may still turn out to be a sleeper. All that "hard
work" in 2017 paid off well with your ETH. Forget the others, although some still have moderately huge value. 

Believe me when I say there is no amount of freelancing that could net you the amount you made in crypto in a year's time. Count your blessings, you still got 
lucky, no regrets.

P.S.
Remember that Bitfinex hack where in a case of bad timing, you sent all your Bitcoin to trade Monero? You get to rebuild even with the haircut refund. I 
remember it was the worst of times, where I was considering to quit.
