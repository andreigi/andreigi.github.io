I noticed this price action recently this past few months. There is no known pattern to technical traders that I know of. The fourth price action chart is 
actually inversed so they all would become uniformed.

The way I see it, it's like a continuous dump or pump and then a period of sideways movement and then finally one last dump or pump before reversing.
