<strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">superior training</strong> (even if you think your ideas are dumb and noobish). 
Because it shows conviction on your own judgement. <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">I encourage everyone serious in trading to do so.</em> Imagine the public embarassment if you continually make bad calls. I applaud the guts of those traders even if the whole crypto twitter ridicules them.</li><li name="c2b0" id="c2b0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Also I like to document my calls and later on brag about them, that’s what Twitter is for, right?</li></ol><p name="7f88" id="7f88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I used to share a lot on Coinfarm, but it’s so time consuming, answering all those questions. And the money is in trading, not mentoring people. Also the referral link shilling is just a tiny amount of what I make.</p><h3 name="af48" id="af48" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why I decided to limited the audience for my charts even if free.</h3><p name="ab0b" id="ab0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Although it’s free, people should respect and acknowledge the hard work of a pro-chartist.

Why? Because it’s becoming a waste of time. Why is that?</p><p name="af73" id="af73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">What’s catch? Just respect.
