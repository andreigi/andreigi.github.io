title: Join us--A Group of Altcoin Technical Traders
categories: [trading, altcoins, coinfarm]
---

* No shilling
* No egos
* Pure chart analysis
* No fees
* No subscriptions

We only talk about altcoin trades, but it’s not exclusive to that. The only requirement is that you share your thoughts on a chart. 
The purpose of the group is to share the workload in finding potential altcoin trade opportunities. This way, you may be able to make profit 
better with less TA work and with less time.

All newbies welcomed. All experts welcomed. All trading methods welcomed. No one is a perfect trader, no one method is right. If your technical 
analysis is just squiggly lines, that’s ok. At least, put up some reasoning behind it.
