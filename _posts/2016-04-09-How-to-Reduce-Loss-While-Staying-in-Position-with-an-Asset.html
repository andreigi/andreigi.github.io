<p name="1a0f" id="1a0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">First off, you don’t have to just watch the value of your bought assets go down the drain and hope that it will recover someday.</p><p name="bb23" id="bb23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Many trading advice say to cut your losers quickly.</em> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">However, you know and insist that you have information that will make the price rally to new highs. </strong>So, you decided to stay in position while the value of your portfolio goes down and down with it.</p><h4 name="acd4" id="acd4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">There is a way to minimize loss if you insist on holding</h4><p name="1e78" id="1e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">For example, you initially bought 10 shares at $10 each, total cost of $100.</p><p name="8714" id="8714" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The price goes down to $9 and you think it will go down further, you then sell all at a loss of $10. You then re-buy 10 shares at $6, totaling a cost of $60, the remaining $30 you keep.</p><p name="eb48" id="eb48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then the price is slipping again. You sold 10 shares for $5 each and lost another $10 value.</p><p name="4e48" id="4e48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You re-bought 10 shares of the asset again at $3, cost of $30 and kept the $20.</p><p name="843c" id="843c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This time, the price stood at $3 for weeks. So now, you have $30 worth of the asset (10 shares) and extra $50 from selling.</p><p name="639a" id="639a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suddenly the price shoots up to $10 each, you now have $100 worth of the asset (10 shares) plus the extra $50, minus the $20 loss, which means a net value of $130.</p><p name="3ee8" id="3ee8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe this is a superior method than “buy and hold” because if you just held 10 shares from start to finish, it’s still $100 worth in the end.</p><p name="ef55" id="ef55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s more if the price shoots up to $20 each, more money for you.</p><p name="22c4" id="22c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Now, if the price never recovers, at least you extracted $50 off it instead of total loss.</strong></p><p name="4412" id="4412" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I advice buying and maintaining the same number of shares from what you initially set on buying in the first place because if you added more to your position in a downtrend, it can be a total loss for you.</strong></p></div></div></section>
