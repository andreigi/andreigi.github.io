Yes, because the crypto market is in a long ranging price range which is surprisingly threatened to crash further down by possible Russia-Ukraine war and 
interest rate hikes (US Federal Reserve Quantitative Tapering) in the U.S. It is funny that Bitcoin is following US Equities tick-by-tick since January 4, 2022.

Also, the narrative that Bitcoin is digital gold is already broken because it crashes during crisis: March 2020 Covid crash and war.

Anyway, download reports by [Electric Capital](/posts-images/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf), [ARK Invest](/posts-images/ARK_BigIdeas2022.pdf) and [The Block Research](/posts-images/The-Block-Research-2022-Digital-Asset-Outlook.v2.pdf). They will definitely give you much hope untill 2030.

In fact, the following are the summaries I gathered from reading them:

ARK Expects Cryptoassets And Digital Wallets To Command Nearly $50 Trillion In Equity Market Capitalization By 2030

Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos, Terra, NEAR, BSC, Avalanche --- Other blockchain networks that garnered at least 5 investments in their ecosystems include 
Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, Cosmos, Flow blockchain, and Polygon.

The largest raise from one of these social networks included the social media platform DeSo (formerly BitClout), which raised a total of $200 million 
during its token sale to investors, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase Ventures, and Sequoia. Other open protocols for content and social 
media that received funding included RSS3, Solcial, Torum. Similar to social networks, other protocols that support streaming like Livepeer, an Ethereum-based 
streaming platform, secured a $20 million funding round led by Digital Currency Group during the third quarter.

The growth in the NFTs/Gaming sector has led to interest in data storage solutions like Arweave, as one of its primary use cases to date has been storing 
the metadata content of NFTs (image, gif, video, or sound).
