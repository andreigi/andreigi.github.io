If you go to https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ now, you will see that there are many cheapskates or maybe spam transactions under 1–30 satoshis per byte 
transaction fee. It roughly means there are many transactions trying to pay with under 3.4 US cents (BTC price: $437, median transaction size of 
258 bytes). **Forty percent of it are paying with 1.1 US cents**.

### Illusion 

The number of unconfirmed transactions you see [here](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) is just an illusion.
The average fees charged under Bitcoin exchanges is roughly 100 bits or 0.0001BTC (4.4 US cents).

I think exchanges should adjust their fees accordingly with such attacks. Using a fee of 160 bits (0.00016BTC, 7 US cents), you wouldn’t feel any delays at all.
