In response to this [post](https://thebitplex.com/?p=220), the Bitcoin price didn’t move much at all when the number of open shorts in Bitfinex dropped 67% because the whale short seller claimed the short sells 
meaning they closed the short position with equivalent BTC – no liquidation at all. It is not entirely a bullish signal because there wouldn’t be any 
short squeeze incoming. What is remarkable is that, this huge whale wouldn’t be opening any large short just after closing its already large shorts.
