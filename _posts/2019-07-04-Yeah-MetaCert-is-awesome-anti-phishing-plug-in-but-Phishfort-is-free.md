I used to have MetaCert’s CRYPTONITE installed and it worked great – No more manually verifying if Bitmex’s address is legit and not fake.

You can’t assume that your old bookmark is still a valid one; hackers and phishers are very creative. Maybe one day, you clicked on that saved link and 
you get unsuspectingly re-directed to a phishing site and then poof your Bitcoin is gone.

That’s why it is vital that for every crypto-related site you visit, you make sure it’s the real one. MetaCert also protects MyEtherwallet (MEW), 
Bittrex, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Binance, etc – all the known crypto sites.

But alas, it’s not free anymore and lately I don’t log in as much as I used to. Thank God, there is a free option which is [Phishfort](https://www.phishfort.com/)
and its [Chrome plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phishfort-protect/bdiohckpogchppdldbckcdjlklanhkfc?hl=en).
Although not as extensive as MetaCert’s CRYPTONITE, Phishfort does the job well. One of these days, it will become popular and have more sites to protect.
