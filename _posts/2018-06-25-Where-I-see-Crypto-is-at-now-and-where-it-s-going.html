<p name="8719" id="8719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The following paragraphs reflect my views 100% (from: <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/" data-href="https://a16zcrypto.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://a16zcrypto.com/</a>)</p><blockquote name="0b83" id="0b83" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Historically, new models of computing have tended to <a href="https://medium.com/software-is-eating-the-world/what-s-next-in-computing-e54b870b80cc" data-href="https://medium.com/software-is-eating-the-world/what-s-next-in-computing-e54b870b80cc" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emerge</a> every 10–15 years: mainframes in the 60s, PCs in the late 70s, the internet in the early 90s, and smartphones in the late 2000s. Each computing model enabled new classes of applications that built on the unique strengths of the platform. For example, smartphones were the first truly personal computers with built-in sensors like GPS and high-resolution cameras. Applications like Instagram, Snapchat, and Uber/Lyft took advantage of these unique capabilities and are now used by billions of people.</blockquote><blockquote name="b421" id="b421" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Blockchain computers were first proposed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto in the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" data-href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. Those original ideas have since been dramatically expanded by developers and researchers around the world. Blockchain computers are new types of computers where the unique capability is <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">trust</em> between users, developers, and the platform itself. This trust <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/563223999543382017" data-href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/563223999543382017" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emerges</a> from the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system, without depending on the trustworthiness of individual network participants. In exchange for these new capabilities, blockchain computers trade off other capabilities such as transaction scalability. This can lead people to dismiss them, in the same way people dismissed early smartphones because they traded off computing power and screen size for portability and new sensors.</blockquote><blockquote name="e0d1" id="e0d1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Trust is a new software primitive from which other components can be constructed. The first and most prominent example is digital money, made famous by Bitcoin. But, as we’ve discovered over the past few years, many other software components can be constructed using the building blocks of trust. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum enable the creation of, among other things, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">application-specific currencies</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721" data-href="https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">digital property rights</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1068" data-href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1068" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open financial instruments</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/davesag/ERC884-reference-implementation" data-href="https://github.com/davesag/ERC884-reference-implementation" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">software-based organizations</a>.</blockquote><blockquote name="03ed" id="03ed" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">From these components, in turn, new infrastructure and applications can be constructed. For example, developers are working on upgrading the core infrastructure of the internet, including storage, networking, <a href="https://ens.domains/" data-href="https://ens.domains/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">identity</a>, and distributed <a href="https://truebit.io/" data-href="https://truebit.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">computation</a>. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-designing-a-price-stable-cryptocurrency-6bf24e2689e5" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-designing-a-price-stable-cryptocurrency-6bf24e2689e5" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stablecoins</a> can enable more mainstream user experiences for digital payments and financial services. <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721" data-href="https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cryptogoods</a> can unlock new experiences and business models for games and other forms of media. Entrepreneurs are developing crypto-powered financial services like the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/traditional-asset-tokenization-b8a59585a7e0" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/traditional-asset-tokenization-b8a59585a7e0" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tokenization</a> of traditional assets, and payment services for the unbanked. We expect many other applications to emerge in the coming years.</blockquote><blockquote name="242c" id="242c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">The new primitive of trust also means that 3rd-party developers, entrepreneurs, and creators can build on top of crypto-powered platforms <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e" data-href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">without worrying</a> about whether the rules of the game will change later on. In an era in which the internet is increasingly <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef" data-href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">controlled</a> by a handful of large tech incumbents, it’s more important than ever to create the right economic conditions for developers, creators, and entrepreneurs. Trust also enables new kinds of governance where communities collectively make important decisions about how networks evolve, what behaviors are permitted, and how economic benefits are distributed.</blockquote><blockquote name="8374" id="8374" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">There are other important trends happening in computing, including the emergence of next-gen computing devices like VR &amp; AR, self-driving cars, drones, and IoT devices. Recent developments in artificial intelligence are extremely exciting and will enable computers to more intelligently interact with the world. We believe that just as the last three megatrends — mobile, social, and cloud — intersected and reinforced each other, so will the next three megatrends — next-gen computing devices, AI, and crypto.</blockquote><blockquote name="32db" id="32db" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Although the Bitcoin whitepaper is now almost 10 years old, we believe we are still early in the crypto movement. The infrastructure needs to be improved and the applications are difficult for non-early adopters to use. Many crypto applications still get <a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/" data-href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dismissed as toys</a>. We believe this will change quickly. For one, crypto is purely a software movement and doesn’t depend on a hardware buildout, in contrast to, say, the internet, which required laying cables and building cell towers. Second, the space is developing extremely rapidly, partly because the code, data, and knowledge is largely open source, and partly because of the increasing inflow of talent.</blockquote><blockquote name="f305" id="f305" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Finally, we are optimistic because we are deep believers in the <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/" data-href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">power of software</a>. Software is simply <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e" data-href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the encoding of human thought</a>, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. We find ourselves consistently surprised and excited by the wide variety of creative crypto ideas we encounter. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">For those of us who have been involved in software for a long time, it feels like the early days of the internet, web 2.0, or smartphones all over again.</strong></blockquote><p name="d9ac" id="d9ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">If you were born in 70s like me, you have seen all of the technological wonders that at first was seemingly impossible and now very commonplace. And you know this is indeed still early for crypto.</p></div></div></section>
