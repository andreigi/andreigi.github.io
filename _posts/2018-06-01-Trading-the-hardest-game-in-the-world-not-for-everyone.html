Actually it applies to ALL MARKETS.</p><blockquote name="ec56" id="ec56" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Welcome to the hardest game in the world.</strong><br>Unfortunately, you’re playing with some of the sharpest, fastest, most intelligent,<br>well informed, stubbornly irrational and in many cases, unethical minds in the world.</blockquote><blockquote name="c06c" id="c06c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">You’re up against the computer that can react faster than you. <br>The trader who has more experience than you. <br>The fund that has more money than you. <br>The insider that has more information than you. <br>The others that will misinform you. <br>The inner voice that will do it’s best to undo you.</blockquote><blockquote name="504d" id="504d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">So, leave all your dreams of making quick and easy money, behind.</blockquote><blockquote name="08bf" id="08bf" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">The first aim is survival. <br>Your absolute first goal is to learn how to stay in the game.</blockquote><blockquote name="c383" id="c383" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">You can only do this by mapping the territory. <br>By understanding how the enemy thinks and acts. <br>By having a solid game plan. <br>And by picking your battles very, very carefully.</blockquote><blockquote name="d300" id="d300" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Ready to play?</blockquote><p name="7711" id="7711" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">So basically if you’re the type that always blames your tools, you will never survive trading crypto, even more so trading in general.</p></div></div></section><section name="b959" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="6b2f" id="6b2f" class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading">Manipulation in markets, specifically cryptocurrencies</h4><p name="62b3" id="62b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Now, there is this anti-Bitcoin writer, <a href="https://medium.com/u/5848671b3f30" data-href="https://medium.com/u/5848671b3f30" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="5848671b3f30" data-action-value="5848671b3f30" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">(((FrancesCoppola)))</a> which wrote:</p><blockquote name="0f33" id="0f33" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Traditional markets can of course also be manipulated, and regulation is perhaps not as effective as it should be. But replacing a manipulated market with an even more manipulated one is not progress. Cryptocurrency advocates should stop pointing the finger at traditional markets and put their own house in order. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/06/01/cryptocurrency-trader-says-the-market-is-manipulated/#7eb7577e25cd" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/06/01/cryptocurrency-trader-says-the-market-is-manipulated/#7eb7577e25cd" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a>.</blockquote><p name="1dce" id="1dce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If you trade long enough, it would be naive of you to think that free markets are really free. As long as there’s money to be made, people will always find ways to manipulate the markets.</p><p name="880e" id="880e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Crypto maybe a new market, but the people trading it are not. As long as there’s something to trade, expect manipulation because you can’t prevent bad actors from bringing along with them their “dastardly” tricks.</p><p name="f553" id="f553" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Manipulation is everywhere.
