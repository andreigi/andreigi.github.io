title: "Why 90% traders fail and Tezos"

Hmm... I want to expand my thoughts on these [actual findings](https://www.tradeciety.com/24-statistics-why-most-traders-lose-money/) about the trading failure 
rate. [(Archived just in case)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190803201636/https://www.tradeciety.com/24-statistics-why-most-traders-lose-money/) discovered by

Also thanks to [@ThisIsNuse](https://twitter.com/ThisIsNuse) and [@jebus911](https://twitter.com/jebus911), Tezos is interesting from a TA point of view 
just look at the chart and bullish divergences.

I don't have any, but if I find the time to swap my underperforming altcoin bags, I'll do it.
