title: "Burnout is real"
---

[Zach](https://www.zachleat.com/web/burnout/) is right. With all the things we can do online, especially if your profession is Internet-related, burnout is
a real thing and happens often. My last burnout happened when I finally achieved the savings I need to finance an IVF procedure for my wife. I was literally
allergic to everything Internet - no Facebook, no emails, nothing, toally unplugged. The slower pace reset my state of mind.
