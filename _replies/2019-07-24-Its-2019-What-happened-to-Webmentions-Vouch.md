title: "It's 2019 - What happened to Webmention's Vouch?"
---

So I was browsing around for more information about Webmentions, its implementation and popularity. I happened to land on
Stuart Langridge's [old post about webmentions](https://kryogenix.org/days/2014/11/29/enabling-webmentions/).

What interests me is the [Vouch](https://indieweb.org/Vouch) feature of Webmentions. I haven't seen any evidence of its use after 
some more browsing of Indieweb sites.

I think this [old post](https://aaronparecki.com/2014/10/17/14/vouch) by Aaron Parecki is a test for vouch.

Anyway, do you want to upload, embed and share [SVG vector files](http://svgshare.com/)? You can try to look around in there.
