title: "Blockchain and Bitcoin"
---

I haven't seen [Kevin Marks](http://www.kevinmarks.com/) talk about blockchains or Bitcoin in a long time. He thinks Bitcoin is antiquated.
I can't blame him, developments are slower compared to other technologies. But he doesn't know that Bitcoin and other blockchain projects are attached
at the hip. Bitcoin is already the barometer for all things blockchain.
