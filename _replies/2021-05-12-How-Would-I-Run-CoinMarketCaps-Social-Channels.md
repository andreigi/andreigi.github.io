title: "How Would I Run CoinMarketCap's Social Channels"
---

I cannot say I'm crypto-obsessed because it is a given in my case since I have a lot of these coins in my portfolio! Because of this reason, I would definitely 
be focused on cryptocurrencies!

If there's one thing I learned from promoting my own content on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/drei4u), Twitter, and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCoinFarm/) is that you have to share valuable information, especially
in crypto. Not only should the shared content be valuable, but it should also be timely and able to foster engagement because a lack of interaction from your
followers only means you have lousy content.

**I will run CoinMarketCap's social channels like my own crypto-related channels**. By making daily posts on social media that matter to Coinmarketcap's audience
which I assume are 100% cryptocurrency traders and investors. They want to hear how their portfolio is doing. So, as the social media manager, I need to make
informative posts, like for example this current week's topics such as Dogecoin peaking, Ethereum making all-time highs and Bitcoin consolidating. Sometimes I 
could provide comic relief by creating memes about the current situation like Elon Musk saying Doge is just a hustle (insert "shots fired.gif" here).

How would I run your channels? Basically by being "crypto-active" and able to share timely coin-related content on them. To have an idea how I do social media,

#### Additional Info

I have a lot of experience in crypto communities throughout the years. Back in 2016, I created a Telegram group of traders which still exists until now. 
It still has 6,000 plus members. The first group is [here](https://t.me/coinfarm) and second one is [here](https://t.me/thecoinfarm).

It actually had more members before the last bear market. This [Bitcointalk post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1382270.0) was the first day I created
the group. I am andreibi, a Legendary account in Bitcointalk.

My Twitter name is Bitcoin Master, I am mostly active in Twitter - <https://twitter.com/drei4u> started posting about Bitcoin and altcoins in 2014 until today. 
My Twitter followers are real and organically grown.
