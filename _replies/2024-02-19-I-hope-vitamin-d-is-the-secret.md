title: "I Hope Vitamin D is the Secret Solution to my Health Issues"
---

I think I have enlarged prostate or Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH). Well, many men over 50 years old will have this problem and most will by 70 years old.
I also have erectile dyfunction and maybe a diffuse kind of androgenetic alopecia (I still have intact hairline!).

I can't believe that 98% of people in Tokyo are Vitamin D deficient and that Vitamin D deficiency is a common global issue. About 1 billion people worldwide 
have vitamin D deficiency, while 50% of the population has vitamin D insufficiency. According to a Nutrition Research report, 42% of American adults are 
deficient in vitamin D. Other studies suggest that number is actually closer to 75%. 

Jesus F Christ! I did more research on this and found out all three of my issues will be solved by Vitamin D3 supplementation!

**I've been seeing good results by feeling good urine flow whenever I pee. And morning wood is getting more common in the mornings.** Of course I have to wait for
a couple of months to check on hair loss.
