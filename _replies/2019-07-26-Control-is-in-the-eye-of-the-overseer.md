title: "Control is in the eye of the overseer"
---

[Control may be an illusion](https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-illusion-of-control) but to the one controlling, it is their reality. Take for instance 
this [cat](https://indiewebcat.com/2019/07/05/2/). It is in his perception that he can remove the foreign object from his body. He doesn't have to know 
that he cannot go against his master's wishes (which is to put a bandage on its front leg).

Same thing applies to humans, we may be small in the grand scheme of things, but we can only change the things we perceived that we can change and accept
the things we cannot change.
