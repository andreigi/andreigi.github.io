I know you are an [iOS Developer](https://www.iamsim.me/plantry-2.8/) but will there be an Android version of Plantry?

Regarding [Code is Law](https://hroy.eu/posts/understandingTechnology/), that is proven untenable by the Ethereum experiment on decentralized autonomous
organization. The code had bugs that could be exploited. So, they changed it.

The step to validate your domain through TLS certificate is very important otherwise your DNS can still be intercepted by a MITM attack with just a 
self-signed certificate. Your [post](https://j605.tk/blog/post/shorts/Using-DNSOverTLS-with-Unbound/) should stress that.
