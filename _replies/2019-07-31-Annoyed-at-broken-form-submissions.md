title: "Annoyed at broken form submissions"

Hey, [Chris](https://boffosocko.com/2019/06/29/social-reading-user-interface-for-discovery/). Didn't you know your comment form submission is broken?
I wrote a beautiful reply to your approach in keeping your social bookmarks in your own website and I was saying that the age of decentralization is 
coming. And that the Facebook, Twitter and Instagram of tomorrow will be a lot different. As I clicked "post comment", it failed and I lost the five
paragraph reply I wrote. ðŸ˜¢

I thought replying directly would be faster cuz the thoughts were already in my head as I was reading your post.
