I assume you already had bitcoins for quite some time now and by holding you hope that your BTC will make you rich someday. Unless you're already rich,
hodling bitcoin won't make you wealthy the way you want to be - hookers and blow, lambos and all. This [article](/why-just-holding-bitcoin-wont-make-you-rich/)
explains why you should be margin trading your stack of bitcoins.

Anyway, you came here to find out **"how to copy bitcoin trades from master traders for free"**. Just like you I hate those paid signal groups which often dupe
people into buying worthless lifetime subscription or copy trading service that either charge you subscription fees yet the master trader sucks. Or maybe you
experience a low-fee subscription mirror trading service but you have to deposit large funds (smells like a future exit scam in the making).

> Well, the copy trading service I'm about to share to you, has no catch at all. 

The way it works is that the Bitcoin margin trading exchange where your trading funds are to be deposited is the one paying the third-party copy trading service
and the copied trader. Each time a follower or a copier's portfolio executes a trade, the exchange pays them. I'm guessing it comes from the trading fees the 
exchanges charges. The thing is you pay the same amount of trading whether you're copying or doing the trade yourself.

Basically the copy trading platform is just a bridge for master traders and their followers. The master trader opens a long or short position in the exchange 
and it broadcasts an api to the platform. The platform then opens a position in the follower's trading account through API. The same goes for closing a 
position.
 
I believe I understand how the bot works. I think it does dollar-cost-averaging when micro-market trends go against the initial position. Thereby adjusting to 
a higher or lower position and then closing into profit. I successfully did an experiment with this in Bitmex. (Show history). It is indeed profitable but
because profits come in small amounts, it is not possible to sustain trading the strategy manually. You have to automate it for sustained profits. 

### Why am I not sharing my own trades?

I actually plan to share my own trades but since I'm relatively new to this service, I have no trade history to brag about except my Twitter calls. In fact,
if you do some browsing at the platform's trader ranking, I'm there. I have yet to build up a trade history so expect it later.
