I will get to the point, you came here to know who are the best traders to copy trade from, who has the most balanced and risk-appropriate trading strategies 
and from which exchange platform is the better value.

So, probably you already know what copytrading is - your portfolio mirrors the trade position and size ratio of the master trader's portfolio; and then you pay 
the lead trader for his services with a percentage of the profit.

### Which exchanges to use?

Two of the best copytrading platforms, you probably already know and maybe you're already a user of said platform. However, if you are still not a user,
I encourage you to sign up for [Bybit](/go-to-bybit/) and [Binance](/funds-are-safu/). Please use my links so that it would incentivize me to review new upcoming
winning traders to copy.

### Which Master Trader to follow?

Now there are several winning traders in the copy trading service, you can actually browse their profiles after you sign up. My advice to you is to choose the
trader with one of the lowest drawdown that's real. What do I mean real? I'm talking about traders who don't risk a large percentage of their recommended margin
by holding already large losses in their active positions. Remember "Let your winners run and cut your losses early." You can always check out a traders'
current unrealised Profit and Loss in the platform.

Also, note their Sharpe Ratio. Numbers above 1 is good, the higher the better. Be mindful of traders that always use high leverage, they tend to fly high and great 
at first but then they didn't cut their losses early and got liquidated. It can happen to anybody, even the best of the best traders.

Note: Why would a trader with high win rate lose so much? Avoid this.

### What about me?

I don't regularly trade my portfolio and when I do, it is in a different platform from the copytrading one. I do however have a [practice account trading history](/btc-futures-journal/).
You can see I have intermittent trading sessions. I also make it a point to fix wrong trade direction in my positions, so you can see there are hardly any
losses.
