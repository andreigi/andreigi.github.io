So, you bought your first Bitcoin. According to some studies, people who buy Bitcoin, purchase $3,000 worth on average. It is almost equal to one month's
salary for a general laborer in the United States. Some may buy $10,000 worth which is almost 1 BTC (_August 28, 2019 price_).

The minimum target for most speculators is to become a USD millionaire. If you bought $3,000 worth, you need the price to go a whopping 33,333%! Whereas
a $10,000 worth of the cryptocurrency, you will need 10,000% increase in price.

The first instance is highly unlikely to happen in our lifetimes because it would mean 1 BTC is $3.4 million while the $10k investment would need BTC to reach
$1 million per coin. Some say this assumption is too far out and no one can predict it may even happen at all. Take note that currently the gold's market is 
valued at $7.5 trillion. A $1m BTC is a $21 trillion market capitalization. So, it's very improbable to happen.

### The best Bitcoin price prediction

According to Tim Draper:

> $250,000 by 2022, and Iâ€™m hedging a little, maybe Q1 2023. It may be Q1 2023, but it will be $250,000 before that.

That was Tim Draper's [latest BTC price prediction](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/tim-drapers-250-000-bitcoin-prediction-to-wait-until-q1-of-2023-201908120957). His
[last BTC prediction](https://www.coindesk.com/tim-draper-bitcoins-price-still-headed-10k) in 2014 was laughed at by many crypto traders. He famously bought lots of BTC
at $600 and then it crashed below $200 (a whopping 69% loss from his purchase price).

**Now this is a more realistic target for holders, but it still won't make you a millionaire**. Why? $3k worth of BTC today will just bring you $73,500 in
Draper's future. The $10k investment will bring $245,000, still a lot short from your one million dollar target.
